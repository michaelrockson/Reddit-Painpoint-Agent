# Contribution Guide

Thank you for contributing to Project Watchtower. This guide explains how to get started, how to structure contributions, and what standards to follow for both backend and frontend work.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a new branch for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Keep changes scoped to a single issue or improvement.
4. Open a pull request against the main branch when ready.

## Project Structure

The repository has two main components:

- `Agent_Backend/` — Python services, pipelines, database models and integrations.
- `Agent_Frontend/` — React + TypeScript UI built with Vite.

When contributing, modify only the component(s) relevant to your change.

## Contribution Workflow

- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`.
- Rebase or merge latest `main` before opening your PR.
- Keep commits focused and use clear commit messages.
- Include a concise PR summary and list any manual testing steps.
- If your change impacts configuration or setup, update docs or README files.

## Coding Standards

### Backend

- Python 3.11+ compatible.
- Follow PEP 8 style and prefer clear, readable code.
- Use meaningful names for functions, classes, variables, and modules.
- Keep business logic in service or pipeline modules not in script entrypoints.
- Add or update documentation comments when behavior is not obvious.

### Frontend

- Use TypeScript types and interfaces for props and state.
- Keep UI components small and reusable.
- Follow existing React patterns in `Agent_Frontend/src`.
- Use CSS modules or existing styling patterns from `App.css` and component styles.
- Avoid unused imports and console logs in development code.

## Testing

- Validate backend changes manually by running the relevant Python entrypoint from `Agent_Backend/`.
- Validate frontend changes with `npm run dev` or the equivalent Vite development command.
- Ensure changes do not break the normal build/start flow for each component.

## Documentation

- Update the root `README.md` or component README when configuration, setup, or behavior changes.
- Prefer short, clear examples and commands.
- Keep documentation aligned with the current codebase and environment requirements.

## Issues and Pull Requests

- If you find a bug, open an issue with steps to reproduce, expected behavior and actual behavior.
- If you implement a feature or fix, reference the issue number in your pull request.
- Use the PR title to describe the change clearly.
- Use checklists in PR descriptions when there are multiple changes or verification steps.

## Code Review Checklist

- Does the change solve the stated problem?
- Is the code easy to follow and maintain?
- Are dependencies kept minimal and appropriate?
- Are docs updated if needed?
- Has the change been tested locally?

## Communication

- If you are unsure about implementation details, open an issue or discussion first.
- For larger changes, describe your intended approach before writing most of the code.
- Keep contributions collaborative and respectful.
