# Project Watchtower

A​‍​‌‍​‍‌ complete software application that helps users find, confirm and monitor problems that can be solved by software and which regularly arise in different areas of life, through Reddit.

The backend is responsible for gathering Reddit discussions, analyzing the sentiments of the posts, validating the opportunities with Gemini and finally, creating structured problem briefs. 

The frontend is the part of the application that the users interact with for authentication, viewing dashboards, managing pipelines and reviewing generated opportunities.

It is possible to save the results in a database and also export them to other services like Notion if ​‍​‌‍​‍‌desired.
