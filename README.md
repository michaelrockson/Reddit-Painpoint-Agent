# Project Watchtower

A full-stack application for discovering, validating and tracking recurring software-solvable pain points from Reddit.

The backend collects Reddit discussions, performs sentiment analysis, validates opportunities using Gemini and generates structured problem briefs. The frontend provides the user interface for authentication, dashboards, pipeline management and reviewing generated opportunities.

Results can be persisted to a database and optionally exported to services such as Notion.
